## 1. Introduction
Provide an overview of the website, its objectives, and its target users. Briefly introduce the structure of the report.

## 2. System Design Overview

### 2.1 Assumptions
- **User Roles**: Assume distinct user roles (Admin, Property Owner, Customer) with different functionalities.
- **Database Connectivity**: Assume a stable connection to the database with no major disruptions during testing.
- **Browsers**: Assume compatibility with major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- **User Experience**: Assume that users have basic computer literacy and can navigate a web interface.

### 2.2 Key Elements of the Problem
- **Property Management**: Need for a robust system to manage property listings, inquiries, and reviews.
- **User Management**: Necessity for secure user accounts for different roles, ensuring that sensitive information is protected.
- **Search Functionality**: Importance of allowing users to easily find properties based on various criteria.

## 3. Website Design

### 3.1 Functional Requirements
- Admin functionalities (dashboard, property management, user management).
- Property owner functionalities (profile management, property listings).
- Customer functionalities (property search, inquiry submission).

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance standards (response times, load handling).
- Usability and accessibility considerations.
- Security measures (data encryption, user authentication).

### 3.3 User-Friendly Features
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear menus and breadcrumb trails for easy navigation.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout for users accessing via smartphones.
- **Search Filters**: Advanced search options to refine property searches.
- **Help Sections**: FAQs and tooltips to assist users in navigating the system.

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1 Coding Practices
- Use of MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for separation of concerns.
- Consistent coding style and documentation for maintainability.
- Utilization of libraries and frameworks to enhance functionality and reduce development time.

### 4.2 Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Individual components were tested to ensure each function operates correctly.
- **Integration Testing**: Combined components tested to verify they work together as expected.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: End-users were involved to validate the system meets their needs.

### 4.3 Components and Functionalities
- **Fully Functional Components**: 
  - User registration and login.
  - Property listing management for owners.
  - Admin dashboard metrics display.

- **Partially Functional Components**: 
  - Search functionality was implemented but requires further optimization for speed.
  
- **Non-Functional Components**: 
  - Advanced filtering options for property searches were planned but not fully developed due to time constraints.

## 5. Installation and Usage

### 5.1 Setting Up a Local Environment
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) installed for local server setup.
2. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone [repository_url]
   ```
3. **Import Database**: 
   - Use phpMyAdmin to import the provided SQL file to create the necessary database tables.
4. **Configure Database Connection**: Edit the `config.php` file with your database credentials.
5. **Run the Application**: Access the application via `http://localhost/[your_project_folder]`.

### 5.2 Login Information
- Default Admin Credentials: 
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `admin123`
  
- Default Property Owner Credentials:
  - Username: `owner`
  - Password: `owner123`

## 6. Input Validation
- **Form Validation**: Input fields validated to ensure correct data types (e.g., email format, numeric values for prices).
- **Client-Side Validation**: JavaScript used for immediate feedback on user input.
- **Server-Side Validation**: All inputs validated on the server to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- **Error Handling**: Informative error messages provided for invalid inputs to guide users in correcting their submissions.

## 7. Conclusion
Summarize the design and implementation process, highlighting the system's effectiveness and areas for future improvement. Discuss how the features added enhance user experience and meet the needs of the target audience.
